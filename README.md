Simple implementation of 2-player competitive Tetris using default Microsoft ASP.NET MVC application template
and SignalR for realtime communication with server (and between players).

It is a competitive version of Tetris. After a player clears a complete line, its opponent has 10 seconds
to clear a line as well. If the opponent fails, a line of a random garbage is generated at the bottom 
of the playing area.
